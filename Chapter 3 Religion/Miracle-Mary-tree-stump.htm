<p>Pilgrims have adorned Passaic, N.J., tree stump they say features likeness of Virgin Mary. </p>
<p><h3>Seeing Mary in  a stump in N.J.</h3></p>
<p><span class="ext_bold"> By PAUL H.B. SHIN    DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER</span></p>
<p>The Lord may work in mysterious ways - but a tree stump in Passaic, N.J.? </p>
<p>A gnarled, 3-foot-tall stump at Hope Ave. and Madison St. has caused a sensation among believers who say the deadwood is a dead ringer for the Virgin Mary. </p>
<p>
"It's incredible," said Pedro De La Luz, 28, who took a picture of the stump with his cell phone to send to his family in Mexico. "Milagro" (miracle), he said. 
</p>
<p>
Pilgrims placed hundreds of votive candles, bouquets and images of the Virgin Mary around the stump since word started spreading last week. 
</p>
<p><b>In the beginning</b></p>
<p>
A woman reportedly spotted the stump Oct. 17 after a business group hired someone to clear the overgrown patch of land next to a highway overpass where addicts were known to use drugs. 
</p>
<p>
"The farther you go back, the better you see the image of the Virgin," said Carlos Curling, 44. "It's just great to see the faith of the people." 
</p>
<p>
Someone had even erected a wooden shelter over the shrine Friday night. 
</p>
<p>
"I was a little skeptical coming here, but when I walked up to it, I said, 'Oh, my God,'" said Linda, 47, of Wayne, N.J., who gave only her first name. 
</p>
<p>Others weren't quite so sure. </p>
<p>
"I'm still thinking about it," said Alicja Poltorak, 49, who came from nearby Clifton, to see it for herself. "It's whatever you believe, I guess." 
</p>
<p>
Margaret, a local Catholic who also gave only her first name, said it was good for the community even though she couldn't see the image herself. 
</p>
<p>
"Even if it's not true, it's good because there are so many bad things in the world," she said. 
</p>
<p>
The Virgin Mary has been sighted by the faithful in Fatima, Portugal; Lourdes, France, and Guadalupe, Mexico.
