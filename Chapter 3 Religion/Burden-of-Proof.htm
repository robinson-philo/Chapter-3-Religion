    <h2>Burden of Proof</h2> <!--Give the chapter name number here-->



You cannot claim that "miracles exist unless someone proves that they do not exist." 
<p>
You cannot claim that "souls exist unless someone proves that they do not exist." 
</p><p>
You cannot claim that "angels exist unless someone proves that they do not exist." 
</p><p>

You cannot claim that "deities exist unless someone proves that they do not exist." 
</p><p>

The burden of proof is always on the claim that X exists rather than on the claim that X does not exist. It is a fallacy to claim that X exists unless you prove that there is no X.  What is improper is for a person to claim that "X exists" and when asked to prove it, then the person who made the claim uses as a defense of "X exists" the next claim that no one has proven that X does not exist.
</p><p>

If a person claims that X exists and is real then the burden is on that person to supply some support for that claim, some evidence or proof that others can and should examine before accepting it. It is incorrect to think that X exists and is real until someone can prove that there is no X. It is also wrong to think that just because you can not prove that X exists that does not mean that X does not exist and therefore X does exist.
</p><p>

Why is it that the burden is on the person who makes the claim?  Well think whether or not it is a better way to proceed through life to accept anything and everything that people claim to be so.  Experience should instruct every thinking human that there is a high probability that not everything that people claim to be true is actually true.  Some claims might be made with the claimant aware that the claim is not true and some claims might be made with the claimant thinking that they are true but being mistaken.  As it is for most humans not a very good idea to proceed through life based on beliefs that are false and thinking things to be true when they are not, most humans and those who would use reason to guide them will want some evidence and reasoning to support a claim being asserted to be true.  So the burden is on those who make claims to offer reason and evidence in support of those claims.
</p><p>

SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF 
</p><p>

The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise. 
</p><p>

The person making a negative claim cannot logically prove nonexistence. And here's why: to know that a X does not exist would require a perfect knowledge of all things (omniscience). To attain this knowledge would require simultaneous access to all parts of the world and beyond (omnipresence). Therefore, to be certain of  the claim that X does not exist one would have to possess abilities that are non-existent. Obviously, mankind's limited nature precludes these special abilities. The claim that X does not exist is therefore unjustifiable. As logician Mortimer Adler has pointed out, the attempt to prove a universal negative is a self- defeating proposition.  These claims are "worldwide existential negatives." They are only a small class of all possible negatives. They cannot be established by direct observation because no single human observer can cover the whole earth at one time in order to declare by personal authority that any .X. doesn't exist. 
</p><p>

Burden of Proof
</p><p>

From  X, which is the assertion, is not yet disproved. Therefore, X. 
</p><p>

This is a Fallacy.  X is unproven and remains unproven. 
</p><p>

 Examples:
</p><p>

(1)Of course God exists. Has anyone ever proven otherwise?
</p><p>

(2)Of course pink elephants inhabit Mars. We don't see them because they blend in. Can you prove otherwise?
</p><p>

 (3)Of course Santa Claus exists. No one has ever proved, to my knowledge, that Santa Claus does not exist. And if one were to fly to the North Pole and say: Well, look, there's no toy factory there. A believer could argue: Well, Santa Claus knew you were coming and moved his operations to the South Pole. So you fly down to the South Pole. No Santa Claus factory, toy factory there. So the believer would say: Oh, he moved it back up to the North Pole.
</p><p>

(4) Of course  leprechauns exist. Has anyone ever proven otherwise?
</p><p>

(5) Of course  ghosts exist. Has anyone ever proven otherwise?
</p><p>

(6) Of course yellow polka dotted aliens exist. Has anyone ever proven otherwise?
</p><p>

(7) Of course  X  exist. Has anyone ever proven otherwise? 
</p><p>

Proof of a Negative Claim
</p><p>

So you simply cannot prove general claims that are negative claims -- one cannot prove that ghosts do not exist; one cannot prove that leprechauns too do not exist. One simply cannot prove a negative and general claim. 
</p><p>

"Negative statements often make claims that are hard to prove because they make predictions about things we are in practice unable to observe in a finite time. For instance, "there are no big green Martians" means "there are no big green Martians in this or any universe," and unlike your bathtub, it is not possible to look in every corner of every universe, thus we cannot completely test this proposition--we can just look around within the limits of our ability and our desire to expend time and resources on looking, and prove that, where we have looked so far, and within the limits of our knowing anything at all, there are no big green Martians. In such a case we have proved a negative, just not the negative of the sweeping proposition in question."-Richard Carrier, "Proving a Negative "(1999) by Richard Carrier  at  http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/theory.html
</p><p>

It is possible to prove rather specific negative claims that are made with rather well defined limits.  If the area to be searched is well defined and of a reasonable size that permits searching then a negative claim might be capable of being proven.  For example, if one claims that there is no apple in the top desk drawer of a desk then all one needs to do is to open the top desk drawer indicated in the claim and examine it for its contents.  Finding no apple therein would provide sufficient evidence under ordinary circumstances to verify or confirm the negative claim that there is no apple in the top desk drawer. 
</p><p>

In this regard Irving Marmer Copi writes:
<i><br>	"In some circumstances it can be safely assumed that if a certain event had occurred, evidence of it could be discovered by qualified investigators. In such circumstances it is perfectly reasonable to take the absence of proof of its occurrence as positive proof of its non-occurrence."</i> - Introduction to Logic, Copi, 1953, Page 95
</p><p>
You can prove a specific negative claim by providing contradictory evidence. An example of a proof of a rather specific negative claim by contradictory evidence would be if someone were to claim that the one and only watch that you own is in the top drawer of the desk.  You make the negative claim that it is not in the drawer and you see it clearly on your wrist.  There is no need to look in the drawer.   
</p><p>

You can also prove specific negative claims when they involve known impossibilities.  For example is someone were to claim that the one and only moon that normally orbits the planet earth was in the top desk drawer.  You claim that the moon is not in the desk drawer.  There would be no need to look inside because the mass of the moon would not fit inside such a space and were its mass to be condensed its mass would be far greater than the desk could support were the desk made of ordinary earth substances. 
</p><p>

You can also prove specific negative claims that can be rephrased as a positive claim.  If someone claims that the lights are not on in room 442 that claim can be rephrased as claiming that the lights are off in room 442.
</p><p>

The claim that you can not prove a negative claim is itself a negative claim and would be a self defeating statement or a retortion were it not generally understood to be a limited claim.  What is usually meant by the assertion that "One can not prove a negative claim" is that it is not logical to insist on proof of claims or statements of the sort: " There is no such thing as X that exists anywhere at all and at any time at all."
</p><p>

Negative claims in the context of religion are very commonly of this form:
</p><p>

"You can not prove that there is no deity"
</p><p>

"You can not prove that there are no miracles"
</p><p>

These claims are asserted by those holding belief in the existence of such phenomena.  They do not usually assert such criticisms against those who claim that there are no phenomena such as those not believed in by the defenders of the existence of a deity or miracles.  For example believers in deity or miracles do not criticize those who claim that there are no tooth fairies or that there are no leprechauns.  The theists appears to think that the critic of theism is claiming that there are no deities and that such a claim can be proven or has been proven.  What is actually being claimed by most critics of the claims that there are deities or miracles is that "There is not sufficient evidence to establish the existence of a deity or a miracle."  or that "It has not been proven that there are deities or miracles."  The burden of proof is on the claimant of the positive claim that an entity X does exist.  The critic of the person making the positive claim that an entity X does exist is asking for evidence in support of that claim and that the evidence be relevant and sufficient to warrant or support the claim.
</p><p>

The unprovability of non-existence.
</p><p>

Here's what the The Objectivist Newsletter (April 1963) had to say on the logical fallacy of proving a negative:
</p><p>

"Proving the non-existence of that for which no evidence of any kind exists. Proof, logic, reason, thinking, knowledge pertain to and deal only with that which exists. They cannot be applied to that which does not exist. Nothing can be relevant or applicable to the non-existent. The non-existent is nothing. A positive statement, based on facts that have been erroneously interpreted, can be refuted - by means of exposing  the errors in the interpretation of the facts. Such refutation is the disproving of a positive, not the proving of a negative.... Rational demonstration is necessary to support even the claim that a thing is possible. It is a breach of logic to assert that that which has not been proven to be impossible is, therefore, possible. An absence does not constitute proof of anything. Nothing can be derived from nothing." If I say, "Anything is possible" I must admit the possibility that the statement I just made is false. (See Self Exclusion) Doubt must always be specific, and can only exist in contrast to things that cannot properly be doubted. .
</p><p>

"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence!"     --
</p><p>
Carl Sagan criticized such "impatience with ambiguity" in cosmologist Martin Rees' maxim, "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence"
</p><p>
It means that if we don't know that something exists and have no evidence that it exists then that is not a sufficient basis for thinking that we have proved that it does not exist at all.  It only means we don't know one way or the other, we just haven't been made aware of it yet so it's not part of our knowledge. This is another variation on  argumentum ad ignorantium,   The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise or that it is false unless proven otherwise.  From a lack of knowledge or any evidence to support a claim it is not appropriate and definitely not safe to reach any definite conclusion about the claim.
</p><p>

The case for evidence of absence depends upon whether or not evidence of any kind exists. If none exists, then absence of evidence is neither evidence of absence or of existence.
</p><p>

If someone claims  that X exists and then there is a search for X but the  more people look in places where X "ought to be" in ways and at times that X "should be likely to be there," and there is no evidence of X found, then the more confidence you can have that there is no "X".
</p><p>

Even if absence of evidence really is evidence of absence in some few well defined cases of very finite extension (e.g., there is no elephant in this desk drawer because there is an absence of evidence of an elephant being in the desk drawer), ignorance of evidence is neither one of those things and shouldn't be mistaken to imply either one. Ignorance of evidence is evidence of ignorance and that is all that it is. 
</p><p>

Rejecting the Burden of Proof
</p><p>

There are those who will refuse to accept that the burden of proof rests with those making positive claims.  They do want to claim that:
</p><p>

"miracles exist unless someone proves that they do not exist." 
</p><p>

"souls exist unless someone proves that they do not exist." 
</p><p>

"angels exist unless someone proves that they do not exist." 
</p><p>

"deities exist unless someone proves that they do not exist." 
</p><p>

Those who behave in this manner are rejecting the use of reason.  They want to believe that X is true or that X exists and to believe it without evidence or even against evidence to the contrary.  They want to have their beliefs remain intact and not subject to refutation or to reexamination for fear of needing to alter their beliefs.  They rest their beliefs  in X existing or in X being true not on evidence and reason but on FAITH and even on BLIND FAITH and when against reason and counterevidence on willfully BLIND FAITH.  Such behavior is within the realm of Religion and not at all acceptable amongst those who would pursue Philosophical discourse or who would ask that reason and evidence support claims.

"Things that Probably don't Exist" by Nick Barrowman    My point is that when it comes to using observational evidence to argue for existence (a positive claim) or non-existence (a negative claim), you can't prove a negative, whereas you can prove a positive.   http://logbase2.blogspot.com/2007/12/things-that-probably-dont-exist.html

<span style=">
	The Logic of Disproof</span></font><p>
	
	
<span style="">
	The following is a perfectly reasonable way to reach a conclusion, in fact 
	the pattern is known as VALID, meaning that if the premises are true the 
	conclusion must be true:</span></font><ol>
		<li>Premise:&nbsp; P&gt;Q</li>
		<li>Premise: not Q</li>
		<li>Conclusion:&nbsp; therefore not P</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
	
	<span style="">
	This pattern of reasoning is known as denying the consequent or</span></font>
	<u><b>modus tollens</b></u><p>
	
	<span style="">
	Here it is with some meaningful statements in the place of the P and Q.</span></font><ol>
			<li>Premise: If there is a fire burning in room 442, then you have 
			Oxygen present in room 442.</li>
			<li>Premise: There is no oxygen in room 442</li>
			<li>Conclusion: Therefore, there is no fire burning in room 442</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
	
	<span style="">
	If Premises 1 and 2 are true the conclusion must be true.&nbsp; Are they 
	true?&nbsp; If so, then the conclusion is true.&nbsp; As a fire is rapid 
	oxidation the absence of oxygen makes a fire impossible.&nbsp; </span>
	</font>
			<p>
	
	<span style="">
	Premise:&nbsp; F then O&nbsp; is making the claim that the O is necessary 
	for the F.&nbsp;&nbsp; It claims the F is sufficient to know there is the O.</span></font><p>
	
	<span style="">
	It is a mistake to confuse a necessary for a sufficient condition and to 
	argue this way.</span></font><ol>
				<li>Premise:&nbsp; P&gt;Q</li>
				<li>Premise: Q</li>
				<li>Conclusion:&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; P</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
	
	<span style="">
	This mistake is called a fallacy and has the name of affirming the 
	consequent.</span></font><p>
	
	<span style="">
	Nevertheless a good deal of thinking preceded with this pattern in science.</span></font><p>
	
	<span style="">
	If the Hypothesis is correct then we will observe what the hypothesis would 
	predict.&nbsp; We do observe what was predicted and the conclusion is at 
	least partially supported that the hypothesis is correct.</span></font><ul>
					<li>Permise: If H, then O</li>
					<li>Premise: O</li>
					<li>Conclusion: H</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
	
	<span style="">
	Science moves forward with greater degree of probability of the conclusion 
	being true through the use of modus tollens which disproves an hypothesis or 
	refutes a claim:</span></font><ul>
						<li>Permise: If H, then O</li>
						<li>Premise: not O</li>
						<li>Conclusion: not H</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
	
	<span style="">
	But even then there might have been something not quite correct in the 
	hypothesis or some auxiliary hypothesis or assumption being made that is 
	being disproven and nto the hypothesis. Perhaps there was the assumption 
	that the measuring being done would be accurate or the devices being used 
	would all function properly and so on.&nbsp; More testing of the hypothesis 
	is generally in order to rule out the other explanations for not detecting 
	the predicted result.</span></font><p>
	<u><b>The logic of proving a negative or non-existence of some X.</b></u><ul>
							<li>Premise: If X exists, then you would observe O</li>
							<li>Premise: We do not observe O</li>
							<li>Conclusion: X does not exist.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
	
	<span style="">
	This pattern is VALID and now what a person would need to check is whether 
	or not the premises are true.</span></font><p>
	
	<span style="">
	If the X is the Tooth Fairy or Easter Bunny or Santa Claus then there are 
	certain observations that should be made.&nbsp; Not ever making those 
	observations despite numerous attempts would lead most humans to conclude 
	that there is no&nbsp; Tooth Fairy or Easter Bunny or Santa Claus , only 
	persons posing as such.</span></font><p>
	
	<span style="">
	However, if the X is some supernatural being or spirit such as a deity or a 
	ghost or even an event claimed to have a supernatural source those who wish 
	to hold for the existence of such beings are not so willing to accept that 
	the existence of the being in reality is disproven and that the being does 
	not exist in reality. What happens?</span></font><ul>
								<li>Premise:&nbsp; If deity D exists, then 
								observe the events O</li>
								<li>Premise: No observation of O</li>
								<li>Conclusion : There is no deity.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
	
	<span style="">
	This would be a VALID argument pattern so if the premises are true the 
	conclusion would be proven to be true. HOWEVER, those who want to hold to 
	the existence of D will introduce auxiliary claims so that the failure to 
	obverse O does not disprove the existence of D.</span></font><p>
	
	<span style="">
	Example:</span></font><ul>
									<li>Premise:&nbsp; If yellow monkeys in the 
									jungle J exist, then you will observe the 
									yellow monkeys in jungle J</li>
									<li>Premise: No observation of yellow 
									monkeys in the jungle J occurs</li>
									<li>Conclusion : There are no yellow monkeys 
									in the jungle J</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
	
	<span style="">
	This would be a VALID argument pattern so if the premises are true the 
	conclusion would be proven to be true.&nbsp; HOWEVER, those who want to hold 
	to the existence of yellow monkeys in the jungle J will introduce auxiliary 
	claims so that the failure to obverse O does not disprove the existence of 
	yellow monkeys in the jungle J.</span></font>.<ul>
										<li>Premise:&nbsp; If yellow monkeys in 
										the jungle J exist and it is a rainy 
										Tuesday, then you will observe the 
										yellow monkeys in jungle J</li>
										<li>Premise: No observation of yellow 
										monkeys in the jungle J occurs on rainy 
										Tuesdays when observations are carried 
										out.</li>
										<li>Conclusion : There are no yellow 
										monkeys in the jungle J </li>
										</ul>
										<p>
	
	<span style="">
	That would appear to disprove the existence of the yellow monkeys in the 
	jungle J except that the believer in the yellow monkeys in jungle J can 
	offer another auxiliary hypothesis or claim.</span></font><ul>
											<li>Premise:&nbsp; If yellow monkeys 
											in the jungle J exist and it is a 
											rainy Tuesday and they want you to 
											see them, then you will observe the 
											yellow monkeys in jungle J</li>
											<li>Premise: No observation of 
											yellow monkeys in the jungle J 
											occurs</li>
											<li>Conclusion : There are no yellow 
											monkeys in the jungle J and it is a 
											rainy Tuesday that want you to see 
											them.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>
											<span style="">
											So the person who wants to believe 
											in&nbsp; yellow monkeys in the 
											jungle J exist&nbsp; can continue to 
											believe in them and claim that they 
											do exist even with no evidence to 
											support the claim.&nbsp; The person 
											who wants to believe in&nbsp; yellow 
											monkeys in the jungle J exist will 
											claim that you did not prove that 
											there were no yellow monkeys in the 
											jungle J and so the person can go on 
											believing that there are yellow 
											monkeys in the jungle.</span></font></p>
											<p>
											<span style="">
											Now substitute a supernatural being 
											of any kind into the position held by 
											the yellow monkeys in jungle J in 
											the arguments above and you should 
											be able to understand why it is so 
											difficult to prove a negative claim.
											</span></font></p>
	<p>
											<span style="">
											Person B claims that deity D exists.&nbsp; 
											Person B does not offer any 
											convincing arguments or evidence or 
											proof that D exists but shifts the 
											burden of proof and claims that D 
											exists unless it can be proven that 
											D does not exist. An attempt to 
											prove that D does not exist might 
											take this form. Let O be the 
											observation of the deity itself.</span></font></p>
											<ul>
												<li>Premise:&nbsp; If deity D 
												exists, then observe the events 
												O</li>
												<li>Premise: No observation of O</li>
												<li>Conclusion : There is no 
												deity.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>
												<span style="">&nbsp;Now 
												the person who claims that D 
												does exist can alter the 
												position in this manner:</span></font></p>
												<ul>
													<li>Premise:&nbsp; If deity 
													D exists and wants to be 
													observed, then we observe 
													the events O</li>
													<li>Premise: No observation 
													of O</li>
													<li>Conclusion : There is no 
													deity that wants to be 
													observed..</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
													<span style="">
													So by introducing features 
													into the initial premise the 
													attempt to disprove the 
													existence of D is thwarted. 
													All manner of post hoc 
													explanations can be offered 
													to explain what was 
													observed.&nbsp; For example 
													the claim could be made that 
													deity D wants people to 
													accept the existence of D as 
													an act of faith in D and so 
													does not make the existence 
													of D obvious or observable.&nbsp; 
													This process can be repeated 
													in many different ways. This 
													makes the attempt to 
													disprove the existence of D 
													very difficult if not 
													impossible.&nbsp; Thus it is 
													that the claim is made that 
													it is difficult if not 
													impossible to prove a 
													negative claim or the 
													non-existence of something.&nbsp; 
													The Burden of Proof is on 
													the positive claim. This 
													stands to reason.&nbsp; This 
													makes sense. This placement 
													of the Burden of Proof makes 
													reasoned discourse possible.

													<p>
													<span style="">
													Or now let D be a deity that 
													is claimed to be All Good 
													and All Knowledgeable and 
													All Powerful..&nbsp; The 
													argument to disprove the 
													existence of D might take 
													this form:</span></font></p>
													<ul>
														<li>Premise 1:&nbsp; If 
														deity D exists, then 
														observe the events 
														O=absence of what is not 
														good</li>
														<li>Premise 2: No 
														observation of O and 
														instead there is 
														observation of things 
														that are not good or 
														evil</li>
														<li>Conclusion : There 
														is no deity D.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>
														<span style="">
														Well this would not 
														prove that there is no 
														deity only that D, a 
														deity that is claimed to 
														be All Good and All 
														Knowledgeable and All 
														Powerful, does not exist 
														.&nbsp; Now the person 
														who claims that there is 
														a deity can now remove 
														on of the three 
														properties and the 
														disproof would no longer 
														be applicable or deny 
														the truth of premise 1. 
														Or the person claiming 
														that there is a deity 
														could deny that what was 
														observed to be evil was 
														evil=denying the truth 
														of premise 2.</span></font></p>
														<p>
														<span style="">
														So the Burden of Proof 
														rests with the person 
														making the claim and a 
														positive claim.&nbsp; It 
														is shifting the Burden 
														of Proof for the person 
														making the positive 
														claim to insist that 
														those who deny the 
														positive claim have the 
														burden to prove that the 
														positive claim is false. 
														It is the Fallacy or 
														mistake of appealing to 
														ignorance to reach a 
														conclusion based on alck 
														of knowledge such as 
														with taking the position 
														that :</span></font></p>

														<span style="">
														If you can not prove 
														that X does not exists, 
														then X does exist.</span></font></p>
														<p>
														<span style="">
														If you can not prove 
														that X is false, then X 
														is true.</span></font></p>

														FALSE DILEMMA or
