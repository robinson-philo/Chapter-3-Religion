    <p><b>Apparitions of Virgin Mary in Zeitun</b></p>
    <p>Starting in April, 1968, Virgin Mary apparitions of light at Zeitun, Egypt, were seen by more than a million people. The apparitions were broadcast by Egyptian TV, photographed by hundreds of professional photographers and personally witnessed by Egyptian President Abdul Nasser, an avowed Marxist. The apparitions lasted for three years with numerous unaccountable healings recorded by various medical professionals. The local police, who initially thought the apparitions were an elaborate hoax, searched a 15-mile radius surrounding the site to uncover any type of device that could be used to project such images. They were completely unsuccessful.

    <p>During three weeks over Christmas 1996, 450,000 people went to view the wall of a black glass building in south Florida where an image of the Virgin Mary had appeared. The rainbow-coloured image on the outside of the building in Clearwater, Florida, is about 50 feet wide and 35 feet tall, and stretches across nine panes of glass.

    <p>"We're not able to explain how the shape appeared or why it appeared," said George Pecoraro, a scientist with a glass manufacturing company. "It could be an accident or maybe it's divine intervention." Carlo Pantano, a professor of materials science and engineering at Pennsylvania State University, said: "We can try to explain it, but not who controlled it or why it happened here at this time." There is also no explanation to the fact that parts of image on nine panes of glass come together so perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>In the spring of 1997, someone threw an acidic substance on part of the image. For a few days, the image lost its artistic precision, but then, overnight, it recovered to the original state.(<i>Source: Associated Press; reported in Share International, June 1997</i> )

        <p><b>Hindu statues drinking milk</b></p>
        <p>
        The biggest worldwide miracle in the previous decade happened when Hindu statues drank milk on 21. 9. 1995. Never before in history has a simultaneous miracle occurred on such a global scale. Television stations (among them CNN and BBC), radio and newspapers (among them Washington post, New York Times, The Guardian and Daily Express) eagerly covered this unique phenomenon, and even sceptical journalists held their milk-filled spoons to the statues of gods - and watched as the milk disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>The media coverage was extensive all over the world, and although some scientists and 'experts' (but not all since some of them witnessed it themselves and reported "an authentic miracle") created theories of "capillary absorption" (although some statues were metal, made of bronze or even gold) and "mass hysteria" (although: (a) it was happening in different places of the world simultaneously, to believers and sceptics, (b) the milk, as a physical substance, was disappearing and (c) the event was not foretold by some charismatic prophet and did not coincide with some other major event), the overwhelming evidence and conclusion was that an unexplainable miracle had occurred.

       <p><b>Seeing Mary in  a stump in N.J.</b></p>
       <p><h4>By PAUL H.B. SHIN    DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER</h4></p>
       <p>The Lord may work in mysterious ways - but a tree stump in Passaic, N.J.? </p>
       <p>A gnarled, 3-foot-tall stump at Hope Ave. and Madison St. has caused a sensation among believers who say the deadwood is a dead ringer for the Virgin Mary. 
       </p>
       <p>"It's incredible," said Pedro De La Luz, 28, who took a picture of the stump with his cell phone to send to his family in Mexico. "Milagro" (miracle), he said. 
       </p>
       <p>
       Pilgrims placed hundreds of votive candles, bouquets and images of the Virgin Mary around the stump since word started spreading last week. 
       </p>
       <p><b>In the beginning</b></p>
       <p>A woman reportedly spotted the stump Oct. 17 after a business group hired someone to clear the overgrown patch of land next to a highway overpass where addicts were known to use drugs. 
       </p>
       <p>
       "The farther you go back, the better you see the image of the Virgin," said Carlos Curling, 44. "It's just great to see the faith of the people."
       </p>
       <p>Someone had even erected a wooden shelter over the shrine Friday night. </p>
       <p>"I was a little skeptical coming here, but when I walked up to it, I said, 'Oh, my God,'" said Linda, 47, of Wayne, N.J., who gave only her first name. 
       </p>
       <p>Others weren't quite so sure. </p>
       <p>"I'm still thinking about it," said Alicja Poltorak, 49, who came from nearby Clifton, to see it for herself. "It's whatever you believe, I guess." 
       </p>
       <p>Margaret, a local Catholic who also gave only her first name, said it was good for the community even though she couldn't see the image herself. 
       </p>
       <p>"Even if it's not true, it's good because there are so many bad things in the world," she said. </p>
       <p>The Virgin Mary has been sighted by the faithful in Fatima, Portugal; Lourdes, France, and Guadalupe, Mexico. </p>

The human ability to interpret essentially random patterns of images or sounds as some recognizable image or sound or pattern is known as <a target="_blank" href="http://skepdic.com/pareidol.html"><u>pareidolia</u></a>, a type of illusion or misperception involving a vague or obscure stimulus being perceived as something known and that is clear and distinct.  This is demonstrated by humans thinking that they see the image of a man in the surface of the moon once prompted to look at it that way or perhaps arriving at the pattern on their own.  Similarly looking at clouds in order to see what patterns they may contain or suggest that resemble animals or some other well known shapes.  The images , known as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-11/i-files.html"><u>simulacra</u></a>, are identified by the brain with some prior image or pattern.

"Carl Sagan hypothesized that as a survival technique, human beings are "hard-wired" from birth to identify the human face. This allows people to use only minimal details to recognize faces from a distance and in poor visibility but can also lead them to interpret random images or patterns of light and shade as being faces."

The phenomena is demonstrated in what people think that they see in clouds, windows with condensation on them, ink blots, or even on food items such as beans or in bagels or on cinnamon buns or grilled cheese sandwiches and the like.  The phenomena is also observed with sounds with what is known as Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) or "white noise" or in a popular form known as "Raudive voices". When people think that they hear a sound or see an image that does not exist at all the mental phenomena is known as &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://skepdic.com/apophenia.html"><i><u>apophenia</u></i></a>,  the spontaneous perception of connections and meaningfulness of unrelated phenomena. The term was coined by K. Conrad in 1958 .   When looking at tables of numbers or looking at statistical reports and finding some special message or significance in those figures , apophenia is called a Type I error.  It is highly probable that apophenia is involved in a number of reports of phenomena that cannot be confirmed with empirical investigations such as  those falling into the realm of the spiritual, supernatural or paranormal,  including apparent appearances of ghosts or reports of events that are attributed to a haunting , Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) or "white noise", perhaps in forms of numerology and in claims about deciphering messages in large amounts of text such as with the Bible Code claims.   People tend to "read into" text what they want to find there in the case of large amounts of text such as the Bible or in vaguely phrased texts such as the work of Nostradamus. 
</p>
<p>In the context of religion with these phenomena people see what they want to see and hear what they want to hear.</p>
<p><b><a target="_blank" href="Burden-of-Proof.htm"><u>: The Burden of Proof</u></a></b></p>
<p>
You cannot claim that "miracles exist unless someone proves that they do not exist."  The burden of proof is always on the claim that X exists rather than on the claim that X does not exist. It is a fallacy to claim that X exists unless you prove that there is no X.  What is improper is for a person to claim that "X exists" and when asked to prove it the person who made the claim uses as a defense of "X exists" the claim next claim that no one has proven that X does not exist.

</p>
<p class="serious">
What is the best way to proceed when there is a report of some appearance of a religious figure on a wall or pancake, etc...  Should the process favor a more natural explanation until proven otherwise?
</p>
<p class="serious">
 The best explanation would be the one that has the best fit with facts or the explanation that is best supported by claims that are themselves each well supported by other well supported claims. This is a process of explanation that rests heavily on the use of reason and the insistence on evidence to support claims about physical events or a physical state of affairs.  So any appearance of any phenomena that is detectable by the senses should have an explanation concerning how the physical state of affairs has come about to produce that appearance to human senses.  The burden of proof concerning physical claims is with those making the positive assertion.
</p>
<p class="serious">
The explanation must also avoid the pattern of thinking that if one cannot prove that X is not the cause then X is the cause.  One can not appeal to the absence of evidence or proof as constituting the basis for any conclusions.  If one cannot prove what caused phenomenon P then one must withhold accepting the conclusion that any particular cause C is the cause of P.
</p>
<p class="serious">

If one cannot prove what caused phenomenon P then one must withhold accepting the conclusion that any particular cause C is the cause of P.
</p>
<p class="serious">
If there is a claim that phenomenon N (natural event-perceived by the senses) was caused by factor S (supernatural cause) then there needs to be evidence to support the claim.
</p>
<p class="serious">
So the explanation of an event such as the appearance of a figure resembling what someone thinks of as a figure from religious history would need to have evidence to support it.  In the absence of physical evidence, then the preponderance of the evidence is support of explanations of phenomena of a similar type might be given "preferred" status until subsequent evidence supports another conclusion.
</p>
<p class="serious">
Using the resort of a supernatural explanation has so many "gaps " in that it is less preferred in the absence of strong evidence in support of a naturalistic explanation or the holding of the expectation of a naturalistic explanation to be forthcoming. The supernatural explanation has no physical evidence (natural) to support it and no explanation of how it is that non-physical entities cause physical events in the natural realm.
</p>
<p class="serious">
There is also the very important question to be answered in this particular case of why it is that anyone alive thinks that they known just what Mary looked like.  Why assume that the image is the image of any particular historical or or mythical entity?  This is a case of a simulacrum.
</p>
<p class="serious">The use of the reasoning pattern :</p>
<p class="serious">
If you can not explain the event or phenomena by use of a natural explanation then it is a supernaturally caused event involving the spiritual or supernatural beings A B, C, etc...
</p>
<p class="serious">
is both illogical and generated by and rests upon faith that is held to sustain hope.  This is a habit of mind that is quite strong as it has consequences thought to be beneficial by the holder of the habit.
