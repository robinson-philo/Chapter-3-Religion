<b>Beginning April 18, for the first time in twenty years, the Shroud of Turin will be on display to the public in Turin, Italy. Despite well-documented forensic and historical evidence to the contrary, the announced viewing has produced renewed claims that the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus.</b>

The following is a summary of the shroud debate by Joe Nickell, Senior Research Fellow with the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP.) Nickell is the author of sixteen books on investigation and the paranormal including <a href="../../../../../My%20Documents/WPDOCS/QCC/COURSES/620/q/book/087975396X"><u>Inquest on the Shroud of Turin</u></a>. During the 1980's, Nickell served on a team of scholarly and scientific experts that evaluated the shroud claims and found them to be false.

<b>The Shroud of Turin Controversy</b>
</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../../../My%20Documents/WPDOCS/QCC/COURSES/620/q/csicop/joe+nickell"><u>Joe Nickell</u></a></b></p>
<p>
<b>For the first time in 20 years, the controversial Shroud of Turin will be placed on exhibit at its home in northern Italy. Not only are pilgrims expected to flock to the site, the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, but many claims are expected to be made for the cloth by its defenders. Some facts are therefore in order.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Historically, the Shroud of Turin is one of some forty reputed burial cloths of Jesus, although it is the only one to bear the apparent imprints and bloodstains of a crucified man. Religious critics have long noted that the Turin shroud is incompatible with the bible, which describes multiple burial wrappings, including a separate "napkin" that covered Jesus' face (<a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=English&amp;version=NIV&amp;passage=John+20:5-7"><u>John 20:5–7</u></a>).</b>
</p>
<p><img src="Shroud2.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_s1027" width="177" height="199"><br />&nbsp;<br /><b>A fake shroud created by Joe Nickell</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
The Turin cloth first appeared in north-central France in the mid-fourteenth century. At that time the local bishop uncovered an artist who confessed he had "cunningly painted" the image. Subsequently, in 1389, Pope Clement VII officially declared the shroud to be only a painted "representation."</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
Years later, this finding was conveniently forgotten by the granddaughter of the original owner. She sold it to the House of Savoy, which later became the Italian monarchy. Eventually the cloth was transferred to Turin. In 1983 Italy's exiled king died, bequeathing the shroud to the Vatican.
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>The shroud's modern history has confirmed the assessment of the skeptical bishop and Pope Clement. Forensic tests of the "blood" — which has remained suspiciously bright red — were consistently negative, and in 1980 renowned microanalyst Walter C. McCrone determined that the image was composed of red ocher and vermilion tempera paint.</b>
</p>
<p><b>Finally in 1988 the cloth was radiocarbon dated by three independent labs using accelerator mass spectrometry. The resulting age span of circa 1260–1390 was given added credibility by correct dates obtained from a variety of control swatches, including Cleopatra's mummy wrapping.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>These findings are mutually supportive. The tempera paint indicates the image is the work of an artist, which in turn is supported by the bishop's claim that an artist confessed, as well as by the prior lack of historical record. The radiocarbon date is consistent with the time of the reported artist's confession. And so on.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>The approach of impartial scientists has therefore been to let the evidence lead to a conclusion. In contrast, self-styled "sindonologists" (sindon being Greek for "shroud") typically begin with the desired answer and work backward to the evidence — challenging anything that would seem incompatible with authenticity.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>For example, they claim to have discovered microbial contamination on shroud samples that may have altered the radiocarbon dating. Yet for there to be sufficient contamination to raise the date thirteen centuries there would have to be twice as much debris, by weight, as the entire shroud itself! Moreover, the Vatican and the Archbishop of Turin have challenged the sample's authenticity, and Walter McCrone insists that the fibers shown in photomicrographs of the piece of cloth "did not come from the 'Shroud' of Turin."</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>For some, belief will always take precedence over historical and scientific evidence. For others, however, the realization that the shroud never held a body should come as no surprise.</b>

<p><b>New "Shroud" Claims Challenged as Spurious</b></p>
<p><b>Amherst, N.Y.<br />
June 1996 New claims concerning the Shroud of Turin, the reputed burial cloth of Jesus, are being challenged by shroud experts. In fact, leading authorities now question the authenticity of the cloth samples on which the findings are based. </b></p>
<p>
<b>The new pro-shroud claims come from a team of four scientists from the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. The team claims -- based on threads allegedly taken from the shroud -- that heavy contamination from bacteria and fungi may have altered the 1988 radiocarbon dating. The implication is that the shroud might be genuine after all. One member of the team reportedly examined the DNA of markings on the cloth and identified them as blood from a human male.</b>
</p>
<p><img src="Shroud2.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_s1027" width="177" height="199"><br />&nbsp;<br /><b>A fake shroud created by Joe Nickell</b>
</p>
<p><b>However these findings are difficult to reconcile either with the cloth's history or with prior tests, say shroud experts. According to Joe Nickell, author of <a href="../../../../../My%20Documents/WPDOCS/QCC/COURSES/620/cgi-bin/q/book/087975396X"><u>Inquest on the Shroud of Turin</u></a> (1988) and an investigative writer for <a href="../../../../../My%20Documents/WPDOCS/QCC/COURSES/620/si/"><span class="CITE"><u>Skeptical Inquirer</u></a> magazine, "There is abundant data on which to judge the shroud a forgery even apart from the carbon dating."</b></p>
<p>
<b>According to Nickell, the shroud first appeared in France in the 1350's, owned by a soldier of fortune who refused to say how he had obtained it. A subsequent bishop's report to Pope Clement detailed how the cloth was used in a healing scam to defraud pilgrims and how its apparent bodily imprint had been "cunningly painted" by a confessed artist.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
Other evidence against authenticity, Nickell says, includes the image's resemblance to French gothic paintings as well as such obvious flaws as a lack of wraparound distortions and "blood" flows that are "picturelike" and still bright red. In 1973 the "blood" failed a battery of forensic tests conducted by internationally known experts.
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>By 1980 new samples had been analyzed by microanalyst Walter McCrone who discovered that both image and "blood" areas had been painted by an artist using a red ocher and vermilion tempera paint.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Finally, in 1988 samples of the shroud's linen were radiocarbon dated by three independent laboratories. Their results were in close agreement and indicated the cloth was woven between 1260 and 1390 -- consistent with the time of the forger's confession, about 1355.</b>
</p>
<p><img border="0" width="407" height="255" src="Shroud4.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"></p>
<p>
<b>The new claims of contamination imply that the shroud is much older than the fourteenth century, possibly dating even from the first century, and that it could be genuine after all.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>However, according to geochemist Paul Damon, professor emeritus at the University of Arizona and one of those who conducted the 1988 radiocarbon tests, "We've dated a lot of linen -- including many Coptic Christian samples -- and have been in close agreement with the historic date, within the precision of the dating method." Damon said he is confident his original findings are correct.
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>The recent study by the Texas team was conducted on a linen sample allegedly taken from the lower right corner of the shroud. However, the Archbishop of Turin, Cardinal Giovanni Saldarini, has publicly challenged the sample's authenticity. He stated that both he and the Vatican "declare that they cannot recognize the results of the claimed experiments."</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Nickell points out that, even if the sample did come from the shroud, its location was far away from any alleged "blood" stains. "This is suspicious in itself and raises serious questions," states Nickell. "The persons involved should promptly and fully clarify the source and location of all the samples allegedly removed from the shroud."</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Walter McCrone, who has, he says, "examined thousands of fibers from 32 different areas of the 'Shroud,'" maintains that the fibers shown in the team's photomicrographs "did not come from the 'Shroud' of Turin."</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>The notion that contamination could alter the carbon date from the first to the fourteenth century is "ludicrous," McCrone says, adding: "A simple calculation shows that a weight of modern biological material necessary to raise the shroud date 1300 years would weigh twice as much as the shroud by itself."  Physicist Thomas Pickett from the University of Southern Indiana agrees, remarking that in such a case "it would be fair to say that the linen was contaminating the bacteria."</b>
