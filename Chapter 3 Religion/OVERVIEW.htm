    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2> <!--Give the chapter name number here-->

<p> We are going to think philosophically about a number of questions and issues related to religion.  The purpose here is neither to convert believers into non-believers nor the other 
way around.  The objective is to demonstrate and encourage applying philosophical thinking to matters of great importance.  Religion is certainly of great importance.  Philosophy is 
based upon reason and religion is based upon faith.  With many of the issues we are about to examine the philosopher will attempt to give reasons and to look for reasons in support of 
beliefs.  Some of the issues raised in this module and in the entire course may be disturbing to the belief systems of some.  In life it is possible to live and live well based upon 
beliefs.  It is possible to respond to some of the questions raised by philosophical reflection by simply declaring, "Well, I believe that..."  Now that response will probably be 
accepted by many people in many situations, in philosophy however, the "I believe it, that's why!" response is not acceptable.  Philosophers need to have reasons for holding to a belief in 
particular after that belief has been called into question. </p>

<p>
 There are many ideas that people have concerning all things and religion in particular which may not be exactly true or not true at all.  Be prepared for that possibility concerning 
issues related to God, Religion, Reality, Knowledge, Truth, Mind, Freedom and many other ideas that are common to our cultural heritage. </p>

<p>
 Concerning religion, there are many questions that philosophers have been dealing with for some time.  The very meaning of "Religion" is subject to philosophical reflection, speculation 
and criticism.  After that the meaning and value of religion are an important matters.  For the religions of the West with their belief in the one god, the idea of god has come into a 
great deal of very careful thinking.  In this module we shall examine those questions. </p>

<P>Theology -deals with religious beliefs in a rational manner and presumes faith</p>
<p><b>Philosophy of religion is rational</b> thought about religious issues and concerns without a presumption of the existence of a deity or reliance on acts of faith.</p>

<p><span class="ext_bold">1.    What is Religion?</span></p>
</ol>
<p>
There are many definitions of religion.  It is not that easy to pin down exactly what religion is and then to insure that the definition distinguishes religion from magic and from cults and sects.  Many people offer definitions without much knowledge of the wide range of religious phenomena and the many different cultural manifestations of religion.  It is a rather common misconception to think that religion has to do with god, or gods and supernatural beings or a supernatural or spiritual dimension or greater reality.  None of that is absolutely necessary because there are religions that are without those elements.  
</p>
<p>
 In this millennium there are over 6.2 billion people on the planet earth.  Most of them would declare that they are religious in some way.  Rough estimates are made that place people in the various traditions.
</p>
<p>
<b>Here is a tabulation from adherents.com and available at:</b>&nbsp; <a href="https://religionscode.wordpress.com/"><u>https://religionscode.wordpress.com/</u></a>

This information is from  a growing collection of over 62,000 adherent statistics and religious geography citations -- references to published membership/adherent statistics and congregation statistics for over 4,200 religions, churches, denominations, religious bodies, faith groups, tribes, cultures, movements, ultimate concerns, etc.
</p>
<p>
The three religions that are proselytizing religions, seeking more members actively are: Christianity, Islam and Buddhism.  Islam is the fastest growing of the traditions and will most likely have the most adherents in the world by 2020.
</p>
<p>
 Some of these religions have no belief in a god.  Some have no belief in the survival of a soul.  Some believe in more than one god.  What do they have that makes them religion?  
</p>
<p>
 Here is the best definition I have ever come across that captures the common core and yet distinguishes religion from other institutions and phenomena.  It is from Federick Ferre in his work <b><u>Basic Modern Philosophy of Religion</u></b>.
</p>
<p>Religion is the most <b>comprehensive</b> and <b>intensive</b> manner of <b>valuing</b> known to human beings.</p>
<p><h3>2.    Characteristics of Religion </h3></p>
<p>
These are the common characteristics or family traits of those members of the category or "family" of religion.  Just as with family members not every member must have every trait but most have most of the traits.  The more any human phenomena demonstrates these traits the more likely it is that it will be included into this category of social institutions known as religion.
</p>
<p><span class="ext_bold"><u>Common Characteristics:</u></span> (family traits)</p>

<li>notion of a deity or absolute, that which is of ultimate concern and importance</li>
<li>ideas on the nature of human beings</li>
<li>the idea of divine providence, destiny, fate</li>
<li>the idea and meaning of human history</li>
<li>problem of evil explained</li>
<li>description of the central problem of human life and suffering idea of an afterlife-life after death</li>
<li>a concept of the world</li>
<li>ideas of human community and ethics-a moral code</li>
<p><span class="ext_bold">3.    Religions of the West -- the one GOD </span></p>
<p>Religions of the West- Judaism-Christianity and Islam share in some common traits or characteristics that distinguish them from other religions in this world. </p>
<p class="serious">
  a.      belief in one god <br />
  b.     belief in linear history<br />
  c.      belief in a sacred scripture- the book 
</p>
<p>
<b> These common features bind the three traditions together.  One god made the universes at the beginning of time and that one god will end the universe.  Each human has a soul and at the death of the body the soul shall separate from the body and go one in another dimension.  There is a judgment to be made concerning the moral worthiness of the soul at death for an eternal reward or lack thereof.  Time is linear and there is but one period of existence for individuals and the entire universe.  Other religions hold for multiple or no deities, cyclic time and reincarnation of souls, even multiple reincarnations. </b>
</p>
<p><span class="ext_bold"> 4.    Problem with the Attributes of deity (god) </span></p>
<p>Concerning the existence of a single supreme deity or god there are a variety of positions or beliefs:</p>
<p>Forms of theistic beliefs:</p>
<p>Monotheism- a belief that there is but one god.</p>
<p class="serious">Theism- one god separate from the creation</p>
<p class="serious">Pantheism- one god existing in the creation-i.e., world=god</p>
<p class="serious">Panentheism-one god , the world is part of god who is greater than creation</p>
<p>Polytheism- is a belief that there are many gods.</p>
<p>Agnosticism-is no clear or definitive knowledge of whether there is a god or not</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
